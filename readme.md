This is my third task given to me as a cyber-security intern at Prodigy InfoTech.
This is a basic Password Complexity Checker in Python code.
This code defines the 'check_password_complexity' function, which accepts a password as input and determines the password's complexity based on its length, uppercase and lowercase letters, numerals, and special characters.
The 'main' function asks the user for a password and outputs the complexity check result.
